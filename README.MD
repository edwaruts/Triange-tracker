Description:
Triangle tracker is a super cool, learning app, with the abillity to detect the type of a triangle when a user keys in the values of the three sides of the triangle. (Equilateral, scalene, is0sceles or not a triangle.)

It's a really useful app to the junior learners and and a beautifull tool for fun and help you relax the mind.

BDD:
This app is therefore expected to work as following:
Be able to display an input button for the user.
Display a submit and a refresh function.
If the values entered by the user are all equal - The result should be "Equilateral triangle: All sides are equal".
If the user enters two equal sides - The result should be "Isosceles triangle: Two sides are equal"
If the user enter values that aren't equal - The result should be "Scalene: No sides are equal"
And if the values entered by the user are quite unrealistic to make a triangle, the the result will be "Not a triangle"
Setup requirements:
